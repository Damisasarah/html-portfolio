<h1>The Best Movie According To Sarah.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all times.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Vampire diaries.</h3>
<p>I love this series so much, at first i thought i would not like it, but i gave it a shot
       and i ended up recomending this movie to every one i know. It is the best 
     supernatural teen movie i have ever seen.
</p>


 <h3>The originals.</h3>
<p>This is another series i love so much, i am really a fan of seasonal movies, it makes me feel as 
    tho i am following the characters life. The originals is actually a spin-off from vampire diaries.
    <br />It follows the life of a family, the michealson family. It indeed has a beautiful story line.

<h3>A tribe called Judah</h3>
<P>This is a Nigerian single movie, it was written and directed by Funke Akindele. The movie follows the life 
    of a single mother and her children and how they overcame the hurdled and troubles life throws at
     them. It is an inspiring movie.
